# Enview_Task

I have used Flask web framework to run the backend service. 
I have used Apscheduler to schedule check the Rule every five minutes
I have used in memory based list types to store the events and alerts

The project requires the following modules
1.flask
2.datetime
3.apscheduler
4.pytz
5.flask_ngrok  (to make the service available on the internet)

please pip install the above packages if not already installed
